Made Few changes to Improve the website performance from the v.1.

Few notiable changes are, reducing amount 3D elements in the website. In V.1, I had total of 3 3D elements. This one only has 1.

Images are also compressed, Added a preloading animation. Allowing JavaScripts, Styles Sheets and 3D to render when preloading animation is finished.

After Desktop:

Removed any hover effects for better user exprience. Recommended by friend.
