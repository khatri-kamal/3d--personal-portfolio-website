## 📖 Introduction [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

Following my introduction to web development during my university course, I wanted to create a personal website to expand my knowledge while learning new JavaScript frameworks. The primary goal was to build personal website with a 3D interactive element into the websites, drawing inspiration from many website on [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/).

For the development of this website, I utilised React as the framework of choice, owing to its widespread adoption and robust features. Complementing React, Tailwind CSS was selected for its versatility and comprehensive set of pre-configured styles, offering a seamless development experience.

Furthermore, I refined my contact form based on insights gained from my university coursework, enhancing its functionality to facilitate seamless communication, allowing users to send messages effortlessly. Additionally, I implemented emailJS to streamline the process of receiving and managing messages, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## 📈 Performance Benchmark [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

These screenshots demonstrate the website performance improvements before and after optimisation. The benchmarks were conducted using the Google Chrome Lighthouse plugin.

<h3>Version 1.0 mobile performance 🌐</a></h1>

This is similar to the tutorial, with a few tweaks of my own.
![Version 1.0 Website Performance ](V1_Website.jpg)

<h3>Version 2.0 Website performance🌐</a></h1>

Made several changes to improve the website performance from the v.1. These changes were made based on testing by friends and myself on different .

- Reduced 3D element down to 2 
- Removed any hover effects for better user exprience. Recommended by friend.
- Removed Tilt effects
- All images are compressed
- Added pre-loading animation: giving 3D element time to load in background while user load to website

These changes reflect the noticable performance improvement of the website from V.1 to V.2.

<h3>Version 2.0 mobile performance improvement</a></h1>

## 📚 Lessons Learned [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

While the tutorial was excellent and taught me React, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js, the most important lesson I learned was improving the performance of a website and finding the right balance between UI, UX, and performance. In version 1, the website looked impressive, but its performance was extremely slow and resource-intensive, especially for older hardware. 

After learning and applying many performance improvements, the current version of the website provides a key balance between UX and performance.
